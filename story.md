the {party} gathers around the fire at a local tavern when a rider delivers a notice to the bar keep.

the notice reads:


"His Highness King Stalman says hey bitches, I need fighters, come to the castle you bitches"


@ 25

upon arival the king Stalman tells you of the dark rumours which have recently been confimed to him

the dark wizard Algolon is working to resurrect the ancient dragon Fortranus from the dead.
the exact location of this is unknown, but rumors say that outside the town of Debina on the wizard Cobolus a known colaborator of Algolon has been sighted.

The king asks this great task of you {party}, go forth and find Cobolus, attempt to assertain the whearabouts of Aloglon and where he plans to carry out this ritual.

@ 50 on the outskirts of Debina, you find the lair of Cobolus and engage him in combat.

defeated cobolus lays near death, but just as you aproach to begin interogating him a flash of purple light blinds, and a massive explosion knocks you backwards. when the dust and smoke clear, you see the chared remains of the once mighty wizard, smoking as the smell of ash and burning flesh fills the air.

Despite you best efforts of examing the his lair you find no conclusive path to Algolon, however you do find a half ruinned map with markings on indicating the location of a fortress deep in the mountains that may offer some clues.

@75

Deep in the mountains you arrive at the Fotress, (it looks scary!).
from the outside the building apears deserted, but upon entry it is clear that it is not.


@ 99

You arrive at the summit of Godsblood Peak, and find Algolon engulfed in a typhoon of magical energy, could it be? has begun the ritual alone? you begin combat at once

@ 100 algolon lays defeated, but the typhoon of magical energy does not subside, rather it grows in power and from the eye of this storm emerges a great black figure.

It is him, Fortranus the Ancient One. His form grows giant and black the massive beast bellows and releases waves of fire from its great gaping maw, its buring orange eyes lock on to your party. From the deep within its massive chest you here it bellow.

Mortals, embrace the end of this world and submit to me, and I shall make your end swift and painless.

You Begin battle with the beast

the {party} lays defeated, their smoldering corpses lay montionless on the swirl of ash & snow, as the great wings of the anchent dragon carry into the skys.


The great beast colapsass onto the ground, brought to near death by the {party}, as it lays, ragged breaths spewing forth small wisps of smoke, you postion yourselves to make the killing blow, a crack of blinding light engulfs your party and the body of the great dragon evaporates into not more than a great stone skeleton as cold as the as the snow that began to fall upon it.
